# LaTeX-Theme4PDF
This set of LaTeX book templates is aimed at making automated PDFs easier. All variables regarding metadata, paper size, themes are saved in one seperate .tex file. The master LaTeX template will read this file and change the book accordingly (e.g. build a colophon based on available metadata).
